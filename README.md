The credit card companies maintain comprehensive data about each of their clients to ensure that they pay back to the company on time otherwise, the company will incur a huge loss after all it is the company that is making the payment on behalf of the client.

Based on the financial capability of a client, they get a credit limit, i.e., the maximum amount they can spend in a month through a credit card. This is to ensure that a client is able to pay back to the company. They also get a one month time window (likely to vary from company to company) to pay back without attracting any fine or late payment charges.



Credit card companies make a huge profit by charging about 2% or 3% of the amount as a transaction fee to the merchant (or seller) at the point of sale. They also heavily bank on the delay in the repayment by a credit card holder so that they can make a profit by charging huge late payment fees. However, the latter comes with a risk. Hence, in order to assess the degree of risk a credit card company should afford to take by giving away credit cards to the general public or an organisation, they maintain data about each of their clients. By analysing the data, they can know what would be the maximum amount they won't be able to recover from their clients yet able to make a significant profit in a financial year to run a sustainable business.
